# Regression

Regression is a widely used Machine Learning technique for analyzing and modeling the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. By establishing a mathematical equation that best fits the observed data, regression helps identify trends, make predictions, and understand the strength and nature of relationships. There are various types of regression, including linear, polynomial, and logistic regression, each suited for different types of data and relationships.

# Linear Regression

Linear regression attempts to find linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. This form of regression is typically categorized as either simple linear regression, or multiple linear regression.

In simple linear regression, the focus is on one independent variable to predict the outcome. The model takes the form: $y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1}$.

In multiple linear regression, multiple independent variables are considered simultaneously, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of how different factors influence the dependent variable. The model takes the form: $y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2} + ... + b_{n}x_{n}$.

The linear regression module in the Machine Learning Toolbox supports both simple and multiple regressions. For more information on linear regression:
